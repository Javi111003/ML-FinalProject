## 📊 Study and Data Analysis

### 1. Introduction

The **Cuban Telecommunications Company S.A. (ETECSA)** provided a dataset for the purpose of developing various studies and models based on **Machine Learning techniques**.
These data reflect the use of different telecommunication services by customers, such as **phone calls, text messages (SMS), balance recharges, and mobile data consumption**, among others.

The main objective of this analysis is to **understand the structure, content, and characteristics** of the dataset, in preparation for its use in predictive models and behavioral analysis.

### 2. General Description of the Dataset

The dataset is organized in a tabular format containing **10,000 records** and **40 variables**, distributed across columns that describe different aspects of each transaction or service usage event.

Each row represents a **Call Detail Record (CDR)**, documenting an event generated by a customer, such as making a call, sending a text message, or connecting to the mobile network.

The following table summarizes the most relevant types of variables:

| Type of Variable              | Example Fields                                           | General Description                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Identifiers**               | `CDR_ID`, `OBJ_ID`, `OWNER_CUST_ID`                      | Uniquely identify each record, object, or associated customer.                                                     |
| **Temporal**                  | `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`                                 | Indicate the start and end date/time of the service used.                                                          |
| **Categorical**               | `SERVICE_CATEGORY`, `FLOW_TYPE`, `USAGE_SERVICE_TYPE`    | Specify the type of service, its category (voice, data, SMS, recharge), and traffic direction (incoming/outgoing). |
| **Numerical**                 | `ACTUAL_USAGE`, `ACTUAL_CHARGE`, `TOTAL_TAX_AMOUNT`      | Measure service usage (e.g., minutes, megabytes, messages) and the associated monetary charges.                    |
| **Nested Structures / Lists** | `CHARGE_LIST`, `CHARGE_SERVICE_INFO`, `BALANCE_CHG_LIST` | Describe charge details, taxes, and balance modifications for each event.                                          |

These fields are complemented by auxiliary information such as measurement units, account identifiers, billing cycles, and reserved columns for future system expansions.

### 3. Data Source and Structure

The records originate directly from **ETECSA’s billing and event registration systems**, which automatically store all operations associated with customer services.

The main file (`muestra.xlsx`) contains the sampled data, while the complementary file (`CDR Specification (ef_cdr_4q).xlsx`) provides the **data dictionary**, including variable descriptions, data types, and relationships between tables.
Among its sheets, it includes specific descriptions for fields such as **CHARGE_LIST** and **CHARGE_SERVICE_INFO**, which expand on the billing and consumption details of each service record.

---

### 4. Data Quality and Preprocessing

Before applying Machine Learning techniques, it is necessary to perform a **data preparation and cleaning process**, including:

* **Temporal consistency verification**, ensuring `START_DATE` ≤ `END_DATE`.
* **Format conversion** for dates, text fields, and numerical values.
* **Handling of missing or null values**, especially in charge and unit fields.
* **Normalization of numerical variables** (usage, charges) to ensure compatibility with ML algorithms.
* **Standardization of categorical variables**, assigning consistent labels or codes.
* **Feature extraction**, such as event duration (`END_DATE - START_DATE`), customer type, time of day, or day of the week.

These steps will ensure data integrity and suitability for subsequent modeling.

### 5. Potential Machine Learning Applications

The ETECSA dataset offers a wide range of analytical and predictive possibilities, including:

1. **Customer Behavior Analysis:**
   Identify usage patterns based on frequency, service type, or average spending.

2. **User Segmentation:**
   Classify customers into groups (clusters) according to their consumption habits or service preferences.

3. **Demand and Usage Prediction:**
   Estimate future service consumption (minutes, data, SMS) based on historical patterns.

4. **Anomaly or Fraud Detection Models:**
   Detect irregular behaviors or inconsistencies in billing and service usage records.

5. **Churn Prediction Models:**
   Predict the likelihood that a user will discontinue a given service.

### 6. Ethical and Privacy Considerations

All analyzed data were **anonymized** prior to use, removing any personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or customer details.
This ensures **compliance with privacy and confidentiality standards**, and guarantees that the analysis focuses exclusively on general and technical service usage patterns.

### 7. Preliminary Conclusions

The initial examination of the dataset provided by ETECSA indicates that it is a **structured, rich, and highly valuable analytical dataset**, well-suited for developing Machine Learning projects aimed at optimizing telecommunication service management.

Based on the available data dictionary, further work will focus on the **semantic interpretation of each variable** and the subsequent stages of **data processing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
